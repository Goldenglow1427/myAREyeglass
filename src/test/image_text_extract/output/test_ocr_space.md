THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH
39
there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its
precincts at all.
It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the west-
ern wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro
with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand
made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there
came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear
and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a
note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of
the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their
performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers per-
force ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of
boring

a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians
looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and
folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next
chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion;
and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three
thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there
came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same
disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.
But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.
tast of duck The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors
and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans
were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lus-
tre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His fol-
lowers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and
touch him to be sure that he was not.
He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of
the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great f¨ºte; and it was his
own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders.
Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter
and piquancy and phantasm-much of what has been since seen in
"Hernani."] There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs
and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the mad-
man fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the
crazy.
