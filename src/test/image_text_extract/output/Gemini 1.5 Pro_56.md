P那n〞Governor of his native province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the canonical books, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth. He gave up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself up in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years. At his death, his heirs found only a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless know, wished to consign them to the fire, but the executor of the estate〞a Taoist or a Buddhist monk〞insisted on their publication. ※Those of the blood of Ts＊ui P那n,§ I replied, ※still curse the memory of that monk. Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory rough drafts. I examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter, while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other enterprise of Ts＊ui P那n . . . his Labyrinth . . .§ ※Here is the Labyrinth,§ Albert said, pointing to a tall, lacquered writing cabinet. ※An ivory labyrinth?§ I exclaimed. ※A tiny labyrinth indeed . . .§ ※A symbolic labyrinth,§ he corrected me. ※An invisible labyrinth of time. I, a barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery. After more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all recall, but it isn＊t hard to image what must have happened. At one time, Ts＊ui P那n must have said: ＆I am going into seclusion to write a book,＊ and at another, ＆I am retiring to construct a maze.＊ Everyone assumed these were separate activities. No one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same. The Pavilion of the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden. This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze. ※Ts＊ui P那n died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no one could find the labyrinth. The novel＊s confusion suggested that it *was* the labyrinth.

Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem. First, the curious legend that Ts＊ui P那n had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of a letter which I discovered.§ Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. He opened the top drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet. He returned holding in his hand a piece of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded with the passage of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular. Ts＊ui P那n＊s calligraphy was justly famous. Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which a man of my own blood had written with a small brush: ※I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths.§ I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went on: ※Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite. I could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. A volume whose last page would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely. I recalled, too, the night in the middle of *The Thousand and One Nights* when Queen Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell the story of *The Thousand and One Nights*, with the risk of again arriving at the night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity. I also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each individual would add a new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders. ※These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest application to the contradictory chapters of Ts＊ui P那n. At this point, I was sent from Oxford the manuscript you have just seen. ※Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, ＆I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths.＊ I had no sooner read this, than I understood.
