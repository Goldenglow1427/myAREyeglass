THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH
39
there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its
precincts at all.
It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the west-
ern wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro
with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand
made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there
came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear
and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a
note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of
the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their
performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers per-
force ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of
boring

a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians
looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and
folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next
chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion;
and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three
thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there
came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same
disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.
But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.
tast of duck The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors
and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans
were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lus-
tre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His fol-
lowers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and
touch him to be sure that he was not.
He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of
the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great fête; and it was his
own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders.
Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter
and piquancy and phantasm-much of what has been since seen in
\"Hernani.\"] There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs
and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the mad-
man fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the
crazy.

THE GARDEN OF
FORKING PATHS
To Victoria Ocampo
In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain
Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen
British divisions, supported by fourteen hundred artillery
pieces, against the German line at Serre-Montauban,
scheduled for July 24, 1916, had to be postponed until the
morning of the 29th. He comments that torrential rain caused
this delay-which lacked any special significance. The
following deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed
by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao
Hockschule, casts unsuspected light upon this event. The
first two pages are missing.

and went out. The station was not far from my house, but
I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I told myself that
I thus run less chance of being recognized. The truth is
that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and
vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of
the main entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate
slowness.
I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket
for a station further on. The train would leave in a few
minutes, at eight-fity. I hurried, for the next would not go
until balf past nine. There was almost no one on the plat-
form. I walked through the carriages, I remember some
farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in
Tacitus' Anxals and a wounded, happy soldier.
At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran
furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform. It was
Captain Richard Madden. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in
the distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the
fearful window.
From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject
happiness. I told myself that the duel had already started
and that I had won the first encounter by besting my ad-
versary in his first attack-even If it was only for forty
minutes by an accident of fate. I argued that so small a
victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was not
so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the
train schedule, I would be in prison ar dead. I argued, with
no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof that
I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful
conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never
left me.
I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new
abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will be
left. To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would under-
take some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were al-

and multiform in otber dimensions of time. I lifted my eyes
and the short nightmare disappeared. In the black and yellow
garden there was only & single man, but this man was as
strong as a statue and this man was walking up the path
and he was Captain Richard Madden.
\"The future exists now,\" I replied. \"But I am your
friend. Can I take another look at the letter?\"
Albert rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened
the top drawer of the high writing cabinet. For a moment
his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready.
I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without & murmur,
at once. I swear that bis death was instantaneous, as if be
had been struck by lightning.
What remains is unreal and unimportant. Madden broke
in and arrested me. I bave been condemned to hang. Abomi-
nably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the city
to be attacked got through to Berlin. Yesterday it was
bombed. I read the news in the same English newspapers
which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder of the
Iearned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun.
The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. He
knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice,
above the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert,
and that I had no other course open to me than to kill
someone of that name. He does not know, for no one can,
of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.

96 / Jorge Luis Borges
Pên- Governor of his native province, learned in astronomy,
in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the canoni-
cal books, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher.
Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth. He
gave up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, of a well.
stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut
himself up in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen
years. At his death, his heirs found only a mess of manu-
scripts. The family, as you doubtless know, wished to
consign them to the fire, but the executor of the estate a
Taoist or a Buddhist monk-insisted on their publication.\"
\"Those of the blood of Ts'ul Pen,\" 1 replied, \"still curse
the memory of that monk. Such a publication was madness.
The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory rough drafts.
I examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third
chapter, while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other
enterprise of Tsui Pèn. - his Labyrinth. ...\"
\"Here is the Labyrinth,\" Albert said, pointing to a tall,
laquered writing cabinet.
\"An ivory labyrinth?\" I exclaimed. \"A tiny labyrinth
indeed ... I\"
\"A symbolic labyrinth,\" he corrected me. \"An invisible
Inbyrinth of time. I, a barbarous Englishman, have been
given the key to this transparent mystery, After more than
a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost
beyond all recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have
happened. At one time, Tsui Pên must have said; 'I am
going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, I am
retiring to construct a maze. Everyone assumed these were
sepurate activities. No one realized that the book and the
labyrinth were one and the same. The Pavilion of the Limpid
Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden. This may
have suggested the ides of a physical maze.
\"To'ul Pén died. In all the vast lands which once
belonged to your family, no one could and the labyrinth.
The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth.

Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the
problem. First, the curious legend that Ts'ul Pen had pro-
posed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of a
letter which I discovered.\"
Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me.
He opened the top drawer in the high black and gilded
writing cabinet. He returned bolding in his hand a piece
of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded
with the passage of time: It was rose colored, tenuous,
quadrangular. Ts'ul Pên's calligraphy was justly famous.
Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which
a man of my own blood had written with a small brush: \"I
leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of
forking paths.\"
I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went
on:
\"Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself
how a book could be infinite. I could not imagine any other
than a cyclic volume, circular. A volume whose last page
would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of
continuing indefinitely. I recalled, too, the night in the mid-
die of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen
Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her
copyist, started to tell the story of The Thousand and One
Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the night upon
which she will relate it, and thus on to ininity. I also
imagined a Platonic bereditary work, passed on from father
to son, to which each individual would add a new chapter
or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.
\"These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed
to have the remotest application to the contradictory chap-
ters of IS'ul Pen. At this point, I was sent from Oxford
the manuscript you have just seen.
\"Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, T
leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of
forking paths.\" I had no sooner read this, than I understood,

This is Step 1 of Learning and Detection. Next comes Step 2, Color Learning.
With the main color framed, long press (press and hold) the small Learning button (right side). A yellow frame is
displayed on the screen, indicating that HuskyLens is learning the color. During this long press, move the HuskyLens
while pointing at the color area, to let HuskyLens learn the color from various distances and angles. Then, release the
Learning button to complete learning that color. Do not press the button again (ignore the prompt); allow the 5-second
time-out to finish.
The long-press learning period can last for just a few seconds. After releasing the Learning button, you allowed the
training to time-out - no more colors to learn. Training is done!
As shown above, the trained color will be shown on-screen as \"\"Color:ID1* with a rectangular Bounding Box. This
\"block\" (of color) will be reported in the Sample OpMode (next step).
If you want to do this over again, short-press the Learning button, then short-press again to Forget the learned color(s).
This will make the plus-sign \"+\" icon appear again. Aim the plus-sign at the center of the color area, and repeat the
learning (long-press the Learning button). Release and let the time-out finish.
This section showed how to train a single color. After completing this tutorial, you may wish to train two colors (e.g. a
Red shade and a Blue shade). This is described near the end of this tutorial.

Angels and Blueberries
by Tara Campbell
\"Why is the sky blue?\" you ask.
Well, it all depends on who's answering.
If you ask a grown-up, you'll probably get an answer about light, and how it
bounces off air particles, and how certain wavelengths (i.e. colors) get
absorbed, and certain colors (i.e. wavelengths) get kicked back out, and those
certain colors/wavelengths (i.e. blue) are the ones that you and I can see.
If you ask a scientist, you'll likely get an even more confusing but way more
convincing version of that answer.
But if you ask a writer, you'll get a different answer every time.
One answer, for example, lies with the special properties of blue fingerpaint.
Whenever children use blue paint, tiny particles of it dissolve from their
hands into the air and color it blue.
Over time the pigment fades, but as long
as there is fingerpainting, there will always be blue sky.
Another answer is related to the blue-eyed creatures at the North and South
Poles. They are always looking up into the sky, and the blue of their eyes
reflects back for the whole world to see. You've probably never heard of
these polar creatures because they know how to hide from satellites and
Tha flection of their eves is all we'll ever see of them.
